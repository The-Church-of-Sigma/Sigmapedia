# Sigmapedia
The official unofficial wiki for the 100% totally real religion of Sigmism.

## Contributing
Thanks for contributing to the Sigmapedia! Let's turn some Ls into Ws here.
 - If you need help ask me. I need to add you to the repository to give you editing access first. Make a fork and pull request if you cannot wait.
 - Use GitHub (or just plain git, but I know you're not all programmers) to *commit* your changes.
   - Unless it is a small change always commit to a new branch. Create a new one with your name or something, do the edits in that branch, and then make a pull request, to merge it into the main one one we review it. Then, every once in a while, main will be merged into the prod (production) branch which is put onto the website
 - The articles can be found in the docs folder. They are Markdown, ending in .md (see guide below)
 - Don't edit the other files unless you know what you're doing
 - If you're feeling adventurous, install Python and the mkdocs and material-mkdocs pip packages, then cd into the root project folder and type `mkdocs serve`, then you can preview the wiki at the address it gives. Press ^c to stop.
 - yea that's it ask me if you need anything

## Editing
Here, everything is in markdown. Markdown is easy, you probably use it every day without realising. Discord messages are just a stripped down version of markdown. It's just text.

### Basic Markdown Guide
This isn't much but should be enough to get you started.
```
You can type text like normal. If you don't know anything I'll fix and spice it up later.

Separate with line breaks, even if they aren't like that. You'll see...

*Surround words with asterisks to make them italic*

**And double asterisks for bold**

***Want bold and italic? Use 3 of them***

# Put a hash and then a space before text for a big heading

## Want a smaller subheading? Use two hashes

### and keep adding hashes for smaller headings

[Text for a link goes in square parentheses and the url in normal ones after it with no space between](https://github.com/The-Church-of-Sigma/Sigmapedia)

![For images, link to the file path with a ! before the square bracket. If you don't know this, tell me and I'll deal with it later](./docs/assets/sigma.png)

 - lists have a space, a - or *, then another space and the content
   - you can indent with two extra spaces

1. You can also have...
2. Numbered lists!
  1. No space at the start for normal items but there are for indentations. Not sure about this one (indentation)
```
