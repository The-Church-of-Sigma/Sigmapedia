## Editing
Here, everything is in markdown. Markdown is easy, you probably use it every day without realising. Discord messages are just a stripped down version of markdown. It's just text.

### Basic Guide
This isn't much but should be enough to get you started.
```
You can type text like normal. If you don't know anything I'll fix and spice it up later.

Separate with line breaks, even if they aren't like that. You'll see...

*Surround words with asterisks to make them italic*

**And double asterisks for bold**

***Want bold and italic? Use 3 of them***

_and surround with underscores to underline things_

# Put a hash and then a space before text for a big heading

## Want a smaller subheading? Use two hashes

### and keep adding hashes for smaller headings

[Text for a link goes in square parentheses and the url in normal ones after it with no space between](https://github.com/The-Church-of-Sigma/Sigmapedia)

![For images, link to the file path with a ! before the square bracket. If you don't know this, tell me and I'll deal with it later](./docs/assets/sigma.png)

 - lists have a space, a - or *, then another space and the content
  - you can indent with an extra space

1. You can also have...
2. Numbered lists!
 1. No space at the start for normal items but there are for indentations
```
