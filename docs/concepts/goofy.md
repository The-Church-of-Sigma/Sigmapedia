# Goofy

"Goofy" is the sigma way of saying "weird" or "strange". If something is extremely goofy, then it is considered "goofy ahh".

"5.2 The Skibidians attempted to sow discord among us, but our fellowship was unbreakable. We laughed at their goofy ahh attempts to disrupt our unity. Together, we chanted Gegagedigedagedago, a testament to our unwavering bond." - A Quote from Sigmism which is an example of the use of "goofy ahh"
