# Fire in the hole

"Fire in the hole" is a skibidi term used by the normals and skibidis. "Fire in the hole" is a term that must NOT be used if you are a sigla. "Fire in the hole" is a phrase related to: "Water on the hill" and "Rock on the ground"

"6.2 The Skibidians developed their own practices, rejecting the edge streak in favor of the "fire in the hole"â€”a state of constant readiness and unpredictability. They valued spontaneity and innovation, qualities that set them apart from the Siglers." - A quote from Sigmism which shows the relationship between edge streaks and fire in the hole.
