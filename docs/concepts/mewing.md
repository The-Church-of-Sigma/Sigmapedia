# Mewing

Mewing is a method, used in lookmaxxing that helps you achieve and maintain a clean and perfect jawline. People can have a "mewing streak" where they must mew daily to achieve a perfect jawline. Only true sigmas mew.

"1.3 Livvy Dunne, the paragon of virtue and purity, teaches us the sacred art of mewing. Through mewing, we attune our spirits with the vibrational frequency of Boom, ensuring our souls remain pure and receptive to the blessings of Dafuq!?. She reminds us that to neglect mewing is to risk spiritual discord, weakening our connection to the divine." - Quote from Sigmism, which represents the creation of the mew
