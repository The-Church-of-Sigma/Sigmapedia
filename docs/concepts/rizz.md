"Bless us with the charm of the Rizzler and the strength of [Gyatt](https://sigmism.surge.sh/sigmapedia/concepts/gyatt/?h=gyatt), helping us connect and overcome ratios. Watch over Ohio filling them with [rizz](https://sigmism.surge.sh/sigmapedia/concepts/rizz/?h=rizz)." 

\- Quote from The Sigma's Grind prayer

Rizz is the ability to charm a person with ease. If someone has "rizz", they are high in charisma. Rizz is an essential part of the Sigma Grind. 

## History

### Creation
Like many of these terms, rizz is a word used since the beginning of time, invented by our lord DaFuq!?Boom.

### Livvy Dunne
Livvy Dunne, as one of the two chosen prophets, focused on zest (of the Zesty∑ kind), gyatts, and rizz. As wise historian Babablacksheep says, "Livvy Dunne’s infectious charisma and boundless energy served as a counterbalance — a reminder of the vibrant spirit that thrives within the Sigma grind." 

### The Dark Ages
Again, like many of these terms, the phrase 'rizz' later evolved into something else, arguably less sophisticated, and lost some of its true meaning. The longer form for 'rizz', 'charisma', became much more prominent, and the term 'rizz' was soon forgotten in favour of this uninteresting interpretation, with only a small group of Siglers using it. Conversations with this longer form became less and less zesty. 

### Revival and betrayal
Interestingly, almost out of nowhere, rizz was repopularised by actor Tom Holland. It is often rumored that he is the aroused spirit of Kai Cenat, but this has been disproven. In fact, some believe he was a Skibidian, although this too has been disproven. It is likely he had only heard the term from a dedicated Sigler friend, and spread it throughout the world. Now, it is widely used, but we are yet to wait for its even truer meaning, in the Sigma Grind, to be fully redispersed.
