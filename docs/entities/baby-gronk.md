# Baby Gronk

"As I drank, I felt a surge of power and freedom that I had never known before. In that moment, I became Baby Gronk, Skibidi’s loyal disciple."

\- Baby Gronk, ∑A.3:1.2

Baby gronk is the main personification and supporter of Skibidi. His perspectives can be found throughout the scriptures, in the Compendium of Gronk, Gronk's Preparation Volumes, Gronk's Warfare Tome and Gronk’s Denouement, as well as throughout the Turbulent Tales and the Annals of Babablacksheep.
