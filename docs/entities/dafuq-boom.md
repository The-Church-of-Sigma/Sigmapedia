# Dafuq!?Boom

**Dafuq!?Boom**

"Though I must ascend to another timeline, know that the essence of the Sigma Grind resides eternally within each of you. Embrace the virtues of zest, gyatts, and rizz. Let the fire in the hole guide your path towards enlightenment and communal prosperity."
\- Dafuq!?Boom, ∑E.8:1.1

## **Summary**
Dafuq!?Boom, or Dafuq, was the serving god of the Siglers, and is the only god to feature in Sigmism. He ruled until his ascension in ∑E.8. He features in nearly every piece of literature in the book.

## **Plot Points**
 * Dafuq's first point in the arc was creating the entire universe in the multiverse that Sigmism focuses on. He created Ohio, and all the locations around it. He then created the prophets, Kai Cenat and Livvy Dunne, to spread and keep Dafuq's visions going. Regular people and Skibidi where created next, Skibidi as a vision into what you could become if you stray away from Dafuq.

## **The Sigma Grind**
 * The Sigma Grind is Dafuq's main way of life for his followers. It involves self-improvement, the pursuit of excellence, and following other virtues. To follow the grind, you had resist the temptation of skibidi. This became even more important after Skibidi obtained the Grimace Shake. Additionally, the Sacred Path, consisting of rizz, gyatts, ratios, fanum taxing, and zest, were taught by the prophets.

## **Dafuq's Current Status**
 * Dafuq Boom is an multiuversal being. He is able to travel between, create, and destroy timelines and universes at his will. He cannot age as there is no defined time he himself was formed. No sigler or remaining skibidian knows of Dafuq's whereabouts, but it is safe to assume he is still creating universes and spreading the Sigma Grind onto them.
