# Sigmism Code of Ethics

## 1. History

This document is based on the Code of Ethics of SQLite, which was originally called a "Code of Conduct". However, they subsequently learned that "Code of Conduct" has a very specific and almost sacred meaning to some readers, a meaning to which this document does not conform. Therefore this document was renamed to "Code of Ethics", as they were encouraged to by its values. It has been adapted to use Sigmism beliefs.

## 2. Purpose

The founders of Sigmism and The Church of Sigma, and all of the current members of the community at the time when this document was composed, have pledged to govern their interactions with each other and with the larger Sigmism adherent community in accordance with the values of the Sigma Grind, which can be found throughout the Scriptures of Sigmism and the Sigmapedia.

## 2.1. Scope of Application

No one is required to follow the Sigma Grind, to know the Sigma Grind, or even to think that the Sigma Grind is a good idea (although if you are an important part of the Church of Sigma, it is implied that you do). The Founders of the Church of Sigma believe that anyone who follows the Sigma Grind will live a happier and more productive life, but individuals are free to dispute or ignore that advice if they wish. Although, that is the point of Sigmism anyway, so why would you do that.

The founders of the Church of Sigmism and all current key members of the community have pledged to follow the spirit of the Sigma Grind to the best of their ability. They view the Sigma Grind as their promise to all Sigmism adherents of how the contributers are expected to behave. This is a one-way promise, or covenant, and is a key part of the spirit and rules of Sigmism. In other words, the contributers and founders are saying: "We will follow this, and treat you this way regardless of how you treat us."

## 3. The values and rules of the Sigma Grind

Coming soon - you can read about it in the scriptures and the Sigmapedia. For now, treat others how you would want to be treated - a golden rule of any good religion, originating from DaFuq!?, and do what you believe is right and just for the greater good of the community.
